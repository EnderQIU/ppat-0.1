RULE & INDEX FILE PLACES
===============
Language transliteration rule files are under the folder where the "lang_code" prefix is as ISO-639.1 classified
 and with the ".rule" postfix.

Place "people.json" and "place.json" in the "index/" folder.

All files must be UTF-8 encoded.


RULE FILE DEFINITIONS
===============

All lines start with a dot "." indicate there is a start of a section. And no multiple sections allowed.
Available sections are listed here:

 .meta                                     Meta information of the rule, see more in META SECTION.
 .to_phonetic                              Rules of translating words into phonetics.
 .phonetics                                List of all consonants and vowels
 .<consonants | vowels | transliteration> <places | people>
                                           Rules of translating phonetics (or words) into Chinese. "Category" indicates
                                           whether the rules are for names of "places" or "people".

At the start of each line also supports comments by starting the line with "//".
Multiple lines comment or comments at tails of lines are not supported.

META SECTION
===============

e.g.

 language_name = string: Name of the language to be transliterated by this rule.


TO PHONETIC SECTION
===============

e.g.

 out = predict(in)
 out = lookup(in)
 out = in

This section contains either some key/value(string) pairs to present rules of translate words into phonetics
 **or** a key/value(script) pair corresponding to a python function with **one** parameter named "in".
This function must return a str type in python and handle all possible exceptions.
This function should be stored in a "lang_code.py" file in "data/rule" directory.

PHONETIC SECTION
===============

e.g.

 consonants = B|P|D|T|G|K|V|W|F|Z|S|DH|TH|ZH|SH|JH|CH|H|HH|M|N|L|R|Y|G|K|H|NG
 vowels     = AA|AE|AH|EY|ER|AX|IH|IY|AO|OW|UH|UW|UH|UW|AY|AW

This section contains all consonants and vowels in this language. There are only 2 keys allowed -- "consonants" and
 "vowels".
The value of this section should be some phonetics separated by "|".

RULE SECTION
===============

Section names should have the syntax:

.<consonants | vowels | transliteration> <places | people>

This section contains some key/value(string) pairs to present rules of transforming phonetics into coordinates of
 chinese characters of the transliteration table.
The <places | people> indicates whether this section are used for translating people names for places' names.

1. <consonants | vowels> section:

Each rule is on separate line, and has the syntax:

 [<pre>)]<match>[(<post>] = <coord>

<pre> and <post> are optional, used to define the prefix and postfix of the match should be. There are some special
 symbols provided:

 \C  Any consonants (1 or more)
 \V  Any vowels     (1 or more)
 ^   Start of the sequence
 $   End of the sequence

The <match> and <coord> fields are necessary parts. Each phonetic is separated by one space and each phonetics sequences
 is separated by "|". And the <coord>'s value should be an integer represents the index of row/column of the <match>
 on the transliteration table.

e.g.

 S | DH TH = 13

2. <transliteration> section:

This section contains some key/value(string) pairs to present rules of transforming coordinates into chinese
 characters.
The <places | people> indicates whether this section are used for translating people names for places' names.

Each rule is on separate line, and has the syntax:

 <coord_c>, <coord_v> = <chinese characters>

e.g.

 9, 11  = 利（莉）

The <coord_c>, <coord_v> fields represent the coordinate of chinese characters of the combination of consonants and/or
 vowels on the transliteration table.
